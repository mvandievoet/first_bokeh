Analysis and comparison of time to act following calls to 311 in nyc

I used the data found @https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9 to create
a pivot table of the average time taken to act on a report made to 311 from jan to sep 2020. I later created a bokeh who's setup
can be found in the nyc_dash folder. The latter could be be accessed when running @http://ip:8080/nyc_dash?username=nyc&password=iheartnyc
